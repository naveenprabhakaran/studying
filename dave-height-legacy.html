                <p>It breaks our hearts to announce the passing of&nbsp;our legendary co-founder, <strong>Dave Hight</strong>, on January 18, 2021 at the age of 91.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>
                    Dave played an integral role in the Boulder community by serving thousands of customers - helping with remodels, small projects, hobbies, or just telling a quick joke to a shopper passing by. He will be remembered for
                    his hard work, innovation, tenacity, and love for his family and community.
                </p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>
                    The spirit of Dave lives on through every interaction here at McGuckin Hardware. When we say we're proud to be family owned and operated, we really mean it. This store was built on a dream and the call to serve a
                    community. McGuckin Hardware continues to stand today through Dave's innovative approach to doing business and the family of Green Vests he built.
                </p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>
                    We will continue Dave's legacy by serving the Boulder community with the same time-honored approach to customer service as we have for the last 66 years. And
                    <a href="/mcguckin-story" data-mce-href="mcguckin-story">the McGuckin story</a> will continue to unfold even as&nbsp;we now enter a new chapter.
                </p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>
                    Of course, Dave will be dearly missed by all of us in the McGuckin family and all those who had the pleasure of meeting him in the aisles. Thank you for your continued support during this&nbsp;very sad time and in the
                    coming days ahead. But now, onward and upward! - just as Dave would have propelled us.
                </p>
